### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Phuong and I am a front-end software engineer with over 1 year of experience. I have always been fascinated by programming and consider myself lucky to have started my career in web development, which aligns perfectly with my passions for creating intuitive applications. Nowadays I mostly work with TypeScript, React and NextJS.
